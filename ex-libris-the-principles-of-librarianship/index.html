    <p>If you ever need a list of incredibly British-sounding city names, simply refer to the sentence, “To obtain a more precise location, a study of the postal services suggested that it should be located in Lancashire, the West Riding of Yorkshire, Cheshire, Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire, Derbyshire or Cumberland” (p. 36).</p>
<hr>
<p>In the depths of the library basement, among the dusty, hand-crank bookcases, I finally found the section on Library and Information Science. Skimming the shelves, <em>The Principles of Librarianship</em> by Donald Urquhart seemed short and digestible. While I hoped the book would explain how literature was organized, I was excited at how wrong I was.</p>
<p>In the elementary school library, massive posters signified different parts of the Dewey Decimal System. After years of seeing these posters, organizing books stuck with me as the library’s purpose, and I forgot about the librarian that helped me find origami books for the first time. </p>
<p>In middle school and high school, my English classes only ever visited the library when we were doing research projects. Sitting in rooms full of students searching online databases, I brushed off the librarian asking students about their projects as a teacher doing their job. </p>
<p>One afternoon, a librarian asked me about Bertrand Russell. It became painfully obvious I knew nothing about him or his work, so I grabbed one of his books, checked it out, and took a few notes. His comments on historical set theory stuck with me as I began studying mathematics at university. </p>
<p>My perception of libraries, librarians, and their purpose was skewed, but my memories of them were always positive. While I enjoyed working in the library, I never truly appreciated why they functioned they way they did, and I wish I had.</p>
<p><em>To my younger self,</em></p>
<p><em>Libraries are not just rooms full of books. They are the place of practice for librarians.</em> </p>
<p><em>Librarians study the needs of their users and adjust their libraries accordingly.</em> </p>
<p><em>Librarians familiarize themselves with countless fields of study to better guide scholars.</em></p>
<p><em>Librarians recommend materials they think would benefit you, not necessarily ones they enjoy.</em></p>
<p><em>Librarians connect with others in their field to leverage resources from countless libraries, all to get you access to the information you need.</em></p>
<p><em>Librarians optimize their services to help the most people as efficiently and effectively as possible.</em> </p>
<p><em>Librarians convince funding organizations that the service they provide is worth funding, even though you can’t put a price on information.</em></p>
<p><em>Every conversation you have with a librarian will be fruitful. They will have insights in whatever work you’re doing, and you’ll almost always walk away with a new direction you want to explore. If you get a book or article or author recommendation, even better. Talk to as many librarians as you can, even if you’re not stuck in your research.</em></p>
<p><em>Seriously, go talk to some librarians,</em> </p>
<p><em>Ronik</em></p>
<p>Recently, I visited my high school library, and I caught up with the librarian that showed me Russell so many years ago. I brought up my current research, and without skipping a beat, he mentioned an author I should look into. The name had been on my list for a while, but I didn’t feel compelled to read any of their works. Given the success of the Russell recommendation, I think I know what I’ll be reading next.</p>

<p>In case you were wondering, here are the 18 principles of librarianship.</p>
<ol>
<li>Libraries are for users.</li>
<li>The failures of an information supply system to satisfy its users are, as a rule, not obvious.</li>
<li>Supply creates demand.</li>
<li>Users must be provided with guides so that they can select the records which may interest them.</li>
<li>Libraries must be able to provide adequate access to the records users may wish to consult.</li>
<li>Libraries have to be paid for.</li>
<li>Libraries, both individually and collectively, must have regard to cost-effectiveness.</li>
<li>Information cannot be valued as a rule in monetary terms.</li>
<li>Libraries must have regard to the law of diminishing returns.</li>
<li>The best is the enemy of the good.</li>
<li>Unit costs for a particular activity should decrease as the magnitude of the activity increases.</li>
<li>No library is an island.</li>
<li>Objective data about users’ requirements should be used in planning developments of libraries.</li>
<li>In considering the use of new techniques and systems, it is necessary to look at the future, not the past.</li>
<li>The staff of a library should work as a team.</li>
<li>A librarian’s post is not a sinecure for a scholar — a librarian’s task is often to facilitate the work of many scholars.</li>
<li>Libraries can be valuable to society.</li>
<li>Librarianship is an experimental science.</li>
</ol>
