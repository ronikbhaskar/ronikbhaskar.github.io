    <p>Gibberish. Jibber-jabber. Gobbledygook. They’re all words for the same idea: nonsense speech. When someone is speaking gibberish, they make absolutely no sense. You can’t derive any meaning from their words. Despite the excessive amount of language being used, whether actual words or just random syllables, there is no information being conveyed. Even the message, “there is no information being conveyed” is not conveyed through gibberish. Gibberish is meaningless, and I want to know how.</p>
<p>How is it possible to communicate nothing through your use of language? Even in the most convoluted scenarios, sequences of words always seem to carry some meaning. Take, for example, Shakespeare’s sonnets. For so many teenagers sitting in English class, Shakespeare’s sonnets are nothing but 400-year-old word vomit, yet those sonnets have shared beautiful stories to countless ears. Despite his penchant for inventing new words, Shakespeare wasn’t producing gibberish. Far from it, his works are literary masterpieces. Either that or someone is paying a lot of money to force teenagers to read his works for no reason.</p>
<p>I don’t think gibberish is characterized by how outlandish the speech seems. Like with Shakespeare, most speech is only meaningful for the intended audience. Normal people listening to legal or medical jargon would have no idea what it means, yet legal and medical jargon are entirely meaningful. It seems that in order to produce meaningless speech, you must produce speech that has no possible audience. If there is no one that can extract meaning from the speech, then it must be meaningless.</p>
<p>Consider the other side of this. Any speech that has an audience is meaningful, and given how much has been said over so many centuries, meaningful speech must have some relatively high probability of aligning with things that have already been said. By the contrapositive, any speech that has a low probability of aligning with things that have been said before is likely meaningless. </p>
<p>From a practical perspective, producing improbable speech may seem like a difficult task, but with the advent of LLMs, this becomes much easier. Modern LLMs trained on the majority of the readable internet are essentially fancy probability distributions of existing text. Unfortunately, asking ChatGPT to produce improbable speech wouldn’t work, because it must produce high-probability speech by default. Just to be sure, I tested this, and it basically came up with a list of silly nouns, mostly animals, food, and space stuff, but that’s not meaningless enough, since it’s a vaguely coherent list. Instead, I modified the behavior of GPT-2 to produce low-probability text while still sticking to English, kinda. I started with the seed, “The following is gibberish:”. Here’s what it came up with.</p>
<p>The following is gibberish:iability interior markup markup Starship markup Starshipnever Afghansaviouraviour pastenever proclamation Netherlands circumstance Starship Computingaviour bould Jackie Lady Lady Lady daytime Lady Lady pulmonary drill Harbaugh forcefully partnering dissu disciplined contradict Harbaugh dissuclaimed 323 Afghanskeyes Narr interior Weather Cookies Cookies Cookies Cookies Cookies Cookies</p>
<p>I still have to iron out some kinks, but I do think this is a promising start. My working theorem on meaningless speech will hopefully lead to the completion of GibberishGPT, because the world clearly needs more useless LLMs.</p>
