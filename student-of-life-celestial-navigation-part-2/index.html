    <p>As a young person with little experience in the world, I am quite familiar with feeling unqualified. Far too often, I find myself given opportunities for which I have absolutely no preparation. It’s easier to recognize you’re unqualified for something when you meet the people who are qualified for the opportunity. I learned this a few years ago when I volunteered at an astronomy night for Cub Scouts. </p>
<p>The event was run by the director of an institute doing cosmic microwave background experiments. Alongside the director, there were two student volunteers: myself and the president of the Ryerson Astronomical Society. Keep in mind, I knew next to nothing about astronomy at this point. I had seen some of Jupiter’s moons through a telescope, but that was about it. Naturally, whenever one of the scouts asked us a question about space, I would just defer to the president. Thankfully, the president was able to answer any questions the scouts had, and I ended up learning quite a bit through the answers.</p>
<p>After a while, the scouts started working on an activity that didn’t require us to do much, so the president and I chatted for a bit. I had no reason to pretend like I knew anything about space, so I let myself ask very stupid questions. I probably could’ve googled how many constellations there were, but it ended up being a good way to start the conversation. As a bonus, I still remember there are 88 constellations, and I still remember a little about how the brightest stars in each constellation are named. The president also cracked a few jokes about Orion’s Sword which I thought were hilarious. If the old president ever sees this, thanks for being awesome.</p>
<p>A few years later, I was in the middle of nowhere with my telescope, when I remembered those jokes about Orion’s Sword. Given the clear conditions, I decided to observe the three stars that make up the sword. Throughout the night, I watched as the sword moved across the sky when I noticed something strange. At its zenith, the sword appeared to be pointing straight down. By this point, I had already made my <a href="/student-of-life-celestial-navigation-part-1/">revelations about the north star</a>, so I quickly realized the sword was pointing south. When I pulled out my compass, the sword was a little off, but not by much, less than a degree. Living in the northern hemisphere, I wasn’t sure how this would hold for the rest of the night, so I waited a bit to observe it again. I followed the direction of the sword until I hit the horizon, and I checked the direction. This time, it was off by even more. As I expected, the Earth was getting in the way of being able to use Orion’s Sword to find south, but it still worked pretty well. With a bit of latitude correction, finding south using Orion’s Sword seemed absolutely possible, it would just require a bit of math. A project for another night, perhaps.</p>
<p>It’s hard to believe that because of a joke I heard a few years ago, I learned about celestial navigation, but I suppose that’s what the student of life is about. A few years ago, I volunteered at an event for which I was extremely unqualified. I don’t quite know why I was given the opportunity, but I am extremely grateful. That opportunity, like so many others, has given me more than I could ever give. Even today, I’m still learning and growing from everything I have been given. Eventually, the day will come when I can offer more than I receive, but even then, I will still keep learning. I will still be a student of life.</p>
