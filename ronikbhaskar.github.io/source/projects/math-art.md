    The butterfly effect says that small changes can lead to drastically different results. This is the foundation of chaos theory. Sometimes, that chaos results in stunning patterns called strange attractors, and I've done my best to capture them here. It's also what you see on the landing page of my site.

## Quick Overview

The butterfly effect says that small changes can lead to drastically different results. This is the foundation of chaos theory. Sometimes, that chaos results in stunning patterns called strange attractors, and I've done my best to capture them here. It's also what you see on the landing page of my site.
