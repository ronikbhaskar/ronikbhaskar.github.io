title: The Oracle Society
description: >-
    Our final project for introductory quantum computing had us create an educational artifact to teach a quantum concept. I chose oracles, which I had the pleasure of studying in complexity theory. Oracles function as a sort of answer machine. They know things that you want to know, but you don't know how they know them. By asking well-formed questions, you can extract relevant information from an oracle. In general, you want to use as few questions as possible.

CW: violence, kidnapping, murder.

Play the game [here](/oracle_society/).

## Background

Our final project for introductory quantum computing had us create an educational artifact to teach a quantum concept. I chose oracles, which I had the pleasure of studying in complexity theory. Oracles function as a sort of answer machine. They know things that you want to know, but you don't know how they know them. By asking well-formed questions, you can extract relevant information from an oracle. In general, you want to use as few questions as possible. 

## Gameplay

Please note that I constructed this narrative very late at night during finals week. It is not cohesive.

You are a detective/hostage negotiator that has discovered a method of communication to a serial kidnapper. Your job is to free the hostages, but doing so requires you to play a twisted game devised by the kidnapper. There are a select number of questions you can use to play the game, and each one will be answered truthfully. Beat the kidnapper's riddle, and they will release the hostages. If your guessing strategy isn't efficient enough, hostages will start dying. Try not to let too many die. Good luck!

## Issues

Note: I will not resolve these issues, but keep them in mind if you decide to play.

1. This game is not mobile compatible.

2. Skipping text too fast can cause buttons to appear before they should.

3. The transitions between deaths don't allow you to pause the text.

4. I didn't playtest the final version of the game enough.
