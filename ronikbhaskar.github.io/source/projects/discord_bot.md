    The bot may have been fake, but the friends we made along the way were real.

## Background

This project was pivotal to my journey as a maker. I discuss it in my [about page](/about).

## Hosting

Currently, the discord bot is being hosted on Heroku, which has been working really well so far. You get 550 free dyno hours per month without providing any payment information, which is plenty for a single project you can just have running during the day.

## Features

### Hangman ðŸ”¤

Igor can play one game, and that is Hangman. Here are the commands you can use to play:

 - `hangman` or `play hangman`
 - `guess _` (ex. `/guess a`)
 - `quit` or `quit game`

### Astronomy ðŸ”­

Igor seems to have become interested in astronomy. Here are a few things Igor knows:

 - `iss`, `location of iss`, `locate iss`, etc.
 - `moon phase`, `phase of moon`, etc.
 - `picture of the day`, `astro pic`, `photo of the day`, etc.

### Dictionary ðŸ“š

In an effort to expand the server's vocabulary, Igor has access to some dictionaries:

 - `define _____` for dictionary.com
 - `udefine _____` for urban dictionary

### Chat ðŸ’¬

Igor doesn't know how to say much. That's it, no caveat.

 - just @ mention Igor in your message and maybe you'll get a response
