this whole thing is based on how we now have email reactions
 - which is clearly a response to how there are too many emails, and many of them are simple acknowledgements, so why have those emails
 - but this wouldn't be a problem if there weren't so many emails to begin with
 - I should calculate how many words I have to consume in emails per day
    - clearly not getting that much novel or useful information
