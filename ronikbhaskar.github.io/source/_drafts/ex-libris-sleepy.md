Anton Chekhov, argued to be one of the best writers of all time, lives on through his plays, his short stories, and "Chekhov's Gun." The priciple goes: if you introduce a gun in the first act, then it must go off by the third act. For the longest time, I understood this as a rule about how to approach the end of a story, and to a large extent, it is. Reading through some of Chekhov's stories, I couldn't help but appreciate the resolution of each one. They weren't always happy or obvious, but they packaged the narratives with clarity and emotion, demonstrating Chekhov's masterful control over storytelling. After reading *Sleepy*, I realized I didn't understand nearly as much as I thought I did about Chekhov's Gun

A few months ago, a friend gave me a collection of short stories by Anton Chekhov to read, hoping that I might get more out of them than he did. I didn't have a bookmark on hand, so I grabbed an old, wire coat hanger and fashioned it into the outline of a skeleton key. Every night, I would read a short story, mark the spot with the key, and set it on my desk. After reading a dozen stories, I seemed to forget them all after a few days. All except for *Sleepy*, this story of a 13-year-old girl that kills a baby. Whenever I read another story in the collection, my mind wandered back to *Sleepy*. At the end of the term, I had to move out of my apartment, so I tossed the book in a box, along with the rest on my desk.

A few months later, I finally had the space to take out my books. Transferring the books to a new shelf, I heard a clang as something hit the floor. I reached down and picked up a skeleton key made from an old, wire coat hanger. Holding the key in my hand, I took the Chekhov collection from the shelf and flipped to page 49, *Sleepy*. After rereading the story a few times, I began picking up on why it was stuck in my head. Along the way, I learned a component of storytelling I wish I had known sooner: the art of the promise.
