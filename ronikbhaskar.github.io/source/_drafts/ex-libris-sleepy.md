A few months ago, a friend gave me a collection of short stories by Anton Chekhov to read, hoping that I might get more out of them than he did. I didn't have a bookmark on hand, so I grabbed an old, wire coat hanger and fashioned it into the outline of a skeleton key. Every night, I would read a short story, mark the spot with the key, and set it on my desk. After reading a dozen stories, I seemed to forget them all after a few days. All except for *Sleepy*, this story of a 13-year-old girl that kills a baby. Whenever I read another story in the collection, my mind wandered back to *Sleepy*. Eventually, I moved, so I tossed the book in a box, along with the rest on my desk.

A few months later, I finally had the space to take out my books. Moving the books to a new shelf, I heard a clang as something hit the floor. I reached down and picked up a skeleton key made from an old, wire coat hanger. Holding the key in my hand, I took the collection from the shelf and flipped to page 49, *Sleepy*. After rereading the story a few times, I began picking up on why it was stuck in my head. Along the way, I learned a component of storytelling I wish I had known sooner: the art of the promise.
