title: Losing Time
tags:

main points
 - lost watch
 - went back, not there
 - couldn't keep searching, had work to do
 - been busy for weeks
 - felt weird without a watch on my wrist
 - spiraling thoughts about why I lost it
 - accepted that watch was gone
 - once the deadline was over, I bought a new one, opened the packaging, and put on my watch
