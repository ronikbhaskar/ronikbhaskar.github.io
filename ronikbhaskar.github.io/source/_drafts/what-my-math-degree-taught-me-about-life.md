every math class functions as "here are some axioms (fundamental statements we will believe to be true). if we assume these are true, what can we conclude?"

not until I finished all my math courses that I thought about where those axioms came from
- yes, we select and proliferate useful ones
- but in a sense, they are arbitrary

eventually, I explored what would happen if I created my own
- mathematically defining bread

then I considered breaking them, changing them
- insert example

alongside interweave axioms of life
- you must go to college
- you must do this
- blah blah blah
- but then adding new axioms, expectations
- then learning to flout old ones (you are not athletic -> )
- ones for the future: you are always behind -> you are always ahead
