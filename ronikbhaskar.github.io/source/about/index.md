Under renovation. Will return shortly.

<!-- I was never the creative one or the artistic one. I was always "that guy that's good at math." -->

<!-- Then COVID hit. -->

<!-- In December of 2020, a welcoming group of friends adopted me into their Discord server. We joked about building more friends, but some part of me kept whispering, *Maybe that's not a bad idea.* So, that month, I built a working [discord bot](/projects/discord_bot). His name was Igor, and despite the lack of functionality, he was full of life and personality. The server members loved him like a pet.  -->


<!-- A few months later, while chatting about the chaos of life with some filmmakers, they mentioned the butterfly effect. I asked about the origin of the phrase, and a few hours later, I found myself stumbling down a rabbit hole of differential equations and strange attractors. A week later, I recreated Lorenz's Butterfly Effectâ€”the beginnings of the [math art](/projects/math-art) project. -->

<!-- This continued incessantly. Someone would throw out a phrase or idea, and I would run with it. As I continued creating, I started finding my voice in code. Despite everything I made, it took me months to finally call myself creative, which would have been impossible on my own. My friends reminded me that I was more than test scores and good grades, and I hope they know how grateful I am. -->

<!-- Without the people closest to me providing constant support and inspiration and critiques, I wouldn't still be creating. If that's you, thanks.  -->

<!-- *Add to the [dialogue](https://ronikbhaskar.github.io/chat), and become part of my story.* -->
