I am a 4th year undergraduate studying CS and math at the University of Chicago. I am a research assistant in the [SAND Lab](https://sandlab.cs.uchicago.edu/index.html) where I'm fortunate to be co-advised by Prof. [Heather Zheng](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~htzheng/) and Prof. [Ben Y. Zhao](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~ravenben/). 

I'm broadly interested in security and privacy for communities with a recent focus on adversarial machine learning. If you're a digital artist, or you're interested in generative AI, I recommend checking out [Glaze](https://glaze.cs.uchicago.edu). I'm proud to work on this project and hopefully similar ones in the future.

While I am relatively new to research, I have made some observations. Computer security research exists in a delicate ethical space. Every discovered vulnerability is an opportunity for attack, but it is also a potential warning. Every defense offers protection to some group, but it also risks unintended side effects and consequences for future technology. As I continue in this field, I hope to learn how to meaningfully consider the implications of my work, regardless of the subfield I research.

<!-- I was never the creative one or the artistic one. I was always "that guy that's good at math." -->

<!-- Then COVID hit. -->

<!-- In December of 2020, a welcoming group of friends adopted me into their Discord server. We joked about building more friends, but some part of me kept whispering, *Maybe that's not a bad idea.* So, that month, I built a working [discord bot](/projects/discord_bot). His name was Igor, and despite the lack of functionality, he was full of life and personality. The server members loved him like a pet.  -->


<!-- A few months later, while chatting about the chaos of life with some filmmakers, they mentioned the butterfly effect. I asked about the origin of the phrase, and a few hours later, I found myself stumbling down a rabbit hole of differential equations and strange attractors. A week later, I recreated Lorenz's Butterfly Effectâ€”the beginnings of the [math art](/projects/math-art) project. -->

<!-- This continued incessantly. Someone would throw out a phrase or idea, and I would run with it. As I continued creating, I started finding my voice in code. Despite everything I made, it took me months to finally call myself creative, which would have been impossible on my own. My friends reminded me that I was more than test scores and good grades, and I hope they know how grateful I am. -->

<!-- Without the people closest to me providing constant support and inspiration and critiques, I wouldn't still be creating. If that's you, thanks.  -->
