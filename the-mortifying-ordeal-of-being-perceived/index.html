    <p>After having my own website for nearly a year now, my biggest concern isn’t that it’ll go down or that the hosting platform will lose my source code. I’m not afraid of people breaking the things I’ve built or stealing it for themselves. What truly terrifies me is knowing that people actually read what I write.</p>
<p>Since the late 2010’s, I’ve heard plenty of friends express disdain about “being perceived,” whether through their Instagram or Twitter or even emails. I would share specific examples, but I fear the wrath of Gen-Z scorned. Each choice to share some part of ourselves—writing an idea, posting a photo, existing in public—offers an opportunity to be perceived. This binary of perception reminds me of another form of binary perception: the Perceptron.</p>
<p>The Perceptron is the grandmother of deep learning models. Before our modern neural networks with hundreds of hidden layers and fancy activation functions, we had a single-layer, linear network called the Perceptron. Designed by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts in 1943, it took 15 years before it was actually built by Frank Rosenblatt in 1958. Made to be a standalone machine, the Mark 1 Perceptron used an array of 20x20 photocells for the input, potentiometers to encode the weights, and electric motors to adjust the weights. One of the first things it learned was how to tell left from right. </p>
<p>Rosenblatt envisioned a future, one where machines could understand language and see the world around us. His innovative work sparked uncertainty for the future, and where there is uncertainty, there is skepticism. Minsky and Papert provided a strong counterexample to power of the Perceptron: it coult not learn the XOR gate. Essentially, given two objects—each one either a “yes” or a “no”—the Perceptron would not be able to tell you whether they were the same. This, combined with a lack of computing power to make the Perceptron viable in practical application, gave skeptics the upper hand. A few years later, scientists entered the first AI winter. Funding was down and interest was low. Discussions about future implications quieted and the field stalled.</p>
<p>To the dismay of many, Rosenblatt was right. We are living through the AI revolution. Everyone with internet has access to state-of-the-art models, and they continue to transform how so many of us approach work and play in our everyday lives. Rather than having conversations about the hypothetical implications of AI, businesses are transforming, the Senate is having hearings, and grassroots movements are growing because AI hit us hard, and we didn’t anticipate the impact. I would never expect anyone to anticipate everything that AI would bring, but that doesn’t mean we should have stopped trying. We shrugged off a revolutionary idea, and now we’re repeating history.</p>
<p>In 2013, Tim Kreider wrote “I Know What You Think of Me,” an opinion piece on the dread of hearing other people’s uncensored opinions about you. While it comments on the Internet Age, it reflects on being known by others as a long-continuing social phenomenon. The idea has since gone viral, turning into countless memes surrounding the iconic quote, “the mortifying ordeal of being known.” What those memes continue to forget is the choice. They forget that you choose whether to submit to being known and to what degree. </p>
<p>Instead of embracing Kreider’s words, we remain woefully unprepared. Today, your voice is louder online than in person. Academics need Twitter accounts. Grassroots movements start on Reddit. Sixty second videos immortalize your existence, and the comments immortalize perceptions of you. Everything you say and do online contributes to public opinion of you, and you can always know those opinions if you choose to look. Unsurprisingly, the people around you know who you are online. Once they communicate this to you, even without forming or sharing any opinions, you fill with a sense of dread. Since 2019, we have labeled this dread the fear of “being perceived.”</p>
<p>The idea—also turned meme—bears strong resemblance to the mortifying ordeal of being known. Even the most seasoned social media experts I know grapple with the existential concept from time to time. As Kreider explained, we must be known in order to benefit from being loved, but the modern social media landscape likely extends far beyond his original conceptions of the idea. Perhaps we could have learned from Kreider’s original message and reflected on how much we were willing to submit. Instead, we don’t think about being perceived before it’s too late.</p>
<p>As technology continues to evolve, the terrors we face will grow, but few of them will be truly new. In some way or another, humans will have faced the same challenges before, likely on a smaller scale. We don’t know when or where they will arise, but we have the ability and resources to learn. We can face an uncertain technological future equipped with the proper knowledge, or we can be surprised when we submit to the mortifying ordeal of being perceived.</p>
