Even the pages themselves were just black text on weathered sheets. There were no colors to be found in this book of colors. After a bit more digging, I finally figured out why.">

<p>My disappointment is immeasurable, and my day is ruined.</p>
<p>I was wandering through the depths of the science archives in the library when I came across a reference set called <em>Colour Index</em>. Each of the nine volumes was so large that they made old-school dictionaries look small. Immediately, my mind started racing with questions. <em>How many colors are there? What distinguishes one color from another? Did the colors in the book weather over time?</em></p>
<p>Excited, I picked up the first volume and started flipping through the pages, but instead of actual colors, it was just black text on weathered paper. I checked the rest, but they were all the same. No colors, just words.</p>
<p>Maybe I missed something, so I started reading the actual words. The volumes were full of tables, so maybe each entry was a separate color just described in words? Nope. Each entry was a chemical dye and its various properties, including printing, fastness, and non-textile usage. As it turns out, this is a reference created by “The Society of Dyers and Colourists.” It’s a reference for which dyes do what.</p>
<p><em>That’s fine</em>, I supposed. <em>It’s still a lot of colors, each with its own description. Let’s see, green, blue, blue, greenish-blue, blue…</em></p>
<p>So, as it turns out, there weren’t that many colors in this book of colors. In fact, there were only 47 total colors, which might seem like a lot, but you can get boxes of crayons with 64 colors pretty easily. </p>
<p>Clearly, I was missing something, so I started to dig deeper into the books for answers. When it comes to dyes, the only component of color they actually care about is hue, and they decided that 47 hues was enough. There are lots of ways to interpret colors, so my assumption was that they were using a hue-saturation-value (HSV) interpretation. Under the HSV model, colors can be described by three components: the color type (hue), the intensity (saturation), and the brightness (value). I suppose the assumption here is that once you have a dye with a certain color type, you can adjust the intensity and brightness yourself. </p>
<p>Still, this seems rather limited. Even in computer models of HSV, there are 256 distinct hues, and computer screens can’t even show all the colors visible to the human eye. Part of this seems to be an issue of distinguishability. Some hues can be very hard to tell apart. By limiting to 47 hues, each one would be very distinct from all the others.</p>
<p>I understand the reasoning for the 47 colors now, but I still didn’t know what they looked like. The volumes kept referencing some <em>Hue Indication Chart</em>, but I didn’t know where to find it until I turned to the inside of the back cover of the first volume. There, I saw it. A thinly-laminated cardstock diagram with all 47 hues. It held up surprisingly well for being printed over 50 years ago. Each hue had a slit next to it, so you could compare it to an actual object. My sweater was #40, green (dull).</p>
<p>Was I hoping to find more colors? Yes. So much of my research has relied implicitly on image and color spaces, so I had high hopes for this. However, if there’s one thing I’ve learned about colors is that it’s a matter of perspective. Color is entirely phenomenological. We have these crazy, complicated electromagnetic radiation sensors on our faces called eyes, and they work with our brain to interpret this experience we call color. The distinction between colors is determined by light, surroundings, language, and, most importantly, individual experience. </p>
<p>I didn’t learn about colors the way I had hoped, but I did learn something new. Having read those volumes, I now understand a new perspective on color, one used by an entire community. Color is all about perspective, and those 47 colors gave me a perspective I wouldn’t get anywhere else.</p>
